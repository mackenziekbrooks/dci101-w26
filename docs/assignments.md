## Blog posts

Each week you’ll write a 300-500 word blog post on your website in response to a prompt. Prompts will invite you to dig deeper into readings, discussion topics, or your own experiences. These posts aren't meant to be busy work, rather they're a chance for you to practice thinking critically and analyzing information. They help me know what you're thinking and *how* you're thinking. Plus, I know that talking a lot in class isn't for everyone. Think of these posts as an extension of your participation. You don't have to know all the answers, just be thoughtful in your questions! 

**General specifications:**

* Create a WordPress post, then turn in the URL in Canvas. 
* 300-500 words.
* Free from grammatical errors, typos. 
* Credit and link out to sources when appropriate. I won't require that you use a certain citation style, but you should be in the habit of crediting sources and using in-text links. If you feel better about using a formal citation style, go for it! 

## Activity log 

Each week we’ll learn a new skill together in class. The activity log will document the ways you practice and build that skill on your own. Logs will be submitted on your website or as a document in Canvas. 

Specifications will be specific to each activity. 

## Digital essay 

Your big project for this course is the composition of a digital essay on a topic related to digital culture and information. The digital essay will combine text (2000-3000 words), multimedia, web design, and data visualization. Work on this project will be distributed throughout the course through research, a proposal, process updates, and a final presentation. The subject of your digital essay is up to you provided it is related to digital culture and information and is approved by the instructor. Essays will be posted to your website. 

Why an essay? While this might feel like a familiar format to you from high school etc, I'd invite you to put aside what you know about the form. Essay comes from the French *to try* and that's where you should start your thinking for this assignment. That doesn't mean your standards should be low, but you should think about this assignment as an *attempt* to do something new. How do you write about digital culture? How do you study it? How do you analyze it? We spend so much of our time on these platforms, but it can be hard to pin down exactly what they're doing. It's hard to analyze something when you don't know how it works! This course is an exploration of the methods for studying digital culture and this assignment should engage at least one of those methods, recognizing that they are new to you and new to other scholars. And recognizing that we have a short time frame to construct these essays!  


## Digital Essay Components 

### Annotated Bibliography

You are not doing this work in a vacuum! It's important to have a sense of the existing scholarship and research in whatever area you're writing about. We might not have a class in it at W&L, but that does not mean that there's not a scholar out there doing similar work. Knowing where to look and how to look is an essential research skill that will benefit you in college and beyond. We'll have at least one session in class dedicated to finding resources. The sources you find for this assignment will be incorporated into your literature review in your final project.

**Specifications:**

* Due February 10 at 12pm. 
* Published to your website, submitted on Canvas. 
* 6-10 sources. 3 must be scholarly sources (books, journal articles, or peer reviewed web sources). 
* Each source should be formatted in an established citation style of your choosing. Use [Zotero](http://library.wlu.edu/zotero) if it helps! 
* Annotations should be at least two sentences. In the first sentence, summarize the source. In the second sentence, say something about why this source is useful for your project.
